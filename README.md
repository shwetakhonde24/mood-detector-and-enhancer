Project Description:

The Mood Detection project focuses on utilizing machine learning techniques, specifically the Random Forest algorithm, to detect the mood of users based on their responses to neuroticism-based questions. The project follows a structured workflow, as depicted in Figure 2. The first step involves training the machine learning model using a dataset that captures the neuroticism trait, one of the Big Five personality traits. Once the model is trained, it is converted into a TFLite model, which allows for seamless integration with an Android application.

To employ the machine learning model within an Android application, the trained model is first developed on a high-powered machine. Subsequently, the model is converted into the .TFLITE format, enabling its loading into a mobile interpreter. The integration of the trained model into the Android Studio environment facilitates its utilization in real-time.

The project incorporates a user login/registration process. After users have successfully logged in, they are presented with mood test questions that pertain to neuroticism. Based on the user's responses, the trained machine learning model predicts the user's mood. Depending on whether the predicted mood is positive or negative, the application provides suggestions for mood-boosting activities to enhance the user's well-being.

Firebase, a robust and scalable platform, is employed for data storage. User data, as well as relevant application data, are securely stored in Firebase.

Future Work:
1. Refining the Machine Learning Model: Continuously improving the machine learning model by incorporating additional data and exploring advanced algorithms could enhance the accuracy and reliability of mood detection.

2. Personalized Recommendations: Tailoring the suggested mood-boosting activities based on user preferences, past responses, and individual characteristics would provide a more personalized user experience.

3. Real-time Mood Tracking: Developing functionality to track the user's mood over time and identifying patterns or trends can offer valuable insights into their well-being and enable targeted interventions.

4. User Engagement and Feedback: Incorporating features that encourage user engagement, such as mood tracking reminders, progress tracking, and feedback mechanisms, can further enhance user satisfaction and the overall effectiveness of the application.

5. Enhanced Data Security and Privacy: Implementing additional security measures, such as data encryption and access controls, to ensure the protection and privacy of user data is essential for building user trust and compliance with data regulations.

The Mood Detection project aims to provide users with a convenient and accessible means to assess and improve their mood based on neuroticism-related factors. By leveraging machine learning and integrating the model into an Android application, the project seeks to enhance user well-being and foster a positive user experience.
